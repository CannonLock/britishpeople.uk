I"Ê<p><strong><em>The OSPool processed over 2.6 million jobs during the week of April 14th - 17th this year and ran over half a million jobs on two separate days that week.</em></strong></p>

<p>OSPool users and collaborators are smashing records. In April, researchers submitted a record-breaking number of jobs during the week of April 14th â€“ 2.6 million, to be exact. The OSPool also processed over 500k jobs on two separate days during that same week, another record!</p>

<p>Nearly 60 projects from different fields contributed to the number of jobs processed during this record-breaking week, including these with substantial usage:</p>
<ul>
  <li>BioMedInfo: University of Pittsburgh PI <a href="https://www.wrightlabscience.com/p/index.html">Erik Wright</a> of the Wright Lab, develops and applies software tools to perform large-scale biomedical informatics on microbial genome sequence data.</li>
  <li>Michigan_Riles: University of Michigan PI <a href="https://gallatin.physics.lsa.umich.edu/~keithr/">Keith Riles</a> leads the Michigan Gravitational Wave Group, researching continuous gravitational waves.</li>
  <li>chemml: PI <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/chemistry/people/faculty/isayev.html">Olexandr Isayev</a> from Carnegie-Mellon University, whose group develops machine learning (ML) models for molecular simulations.</li>
  <li>CompBinFormMod: Researcher PI  <a href="https://hutchisonlab.org/">Geoffrey Hutchison</a> from the University of Pittsburgh, looking at data-driven ML as surrogates for quantum chemical methods to improve existing processes and next-generation atomistic force fields.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any researcher tackling a problem that can run as many self-contained jobs can harness the capacity of the OSPool.
