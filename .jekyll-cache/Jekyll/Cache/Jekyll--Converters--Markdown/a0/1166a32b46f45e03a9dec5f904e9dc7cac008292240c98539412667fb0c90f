I"<p>On October 1, 2017, Rainer Weiss, Barry Barish, and Kip Thorne were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics “for decisive contributions to the LIGO detector and the observation of gravitational waves.” LIGO confirmed the first direct observation of gravitational waves on September 14, 2015. Both LIGO detectors, one in Hanford, Washington, and one in Livingston, Louisiana, observed a gravitational wave from the merger of two black holes, and with that, the final piece of Einstein’s general theory of relativity fell into place.</p>
