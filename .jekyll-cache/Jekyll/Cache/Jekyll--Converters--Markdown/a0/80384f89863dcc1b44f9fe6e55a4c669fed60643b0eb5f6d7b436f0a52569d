<h2 id="pools-in-the-osg">Pools in the OSG</h2>

<p>Each of the more than 20 OSG pools (previously ‚Äúvirtual organizations‚Äù or ‚ÄúVOs‚Äù)
consists of computing and data capacity operated via OSG and <a href="https://htcondor.org">HTCSS</a> technologies 
and services, as well as any additional resources and services provided by/for 
the pool‚Äôs relevant research community.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org/d/000000043/pilot-jobs-summary?orgId=1&amp;from=now-1y&amp;to=now&amp;var-VOName=All&amp;var-Facility=All&amp;var-ExitCode=All&amp;var-Probe=All&amp;var-interval=7d">A list of OSG pools and compute usage within each is available in the OSG‚Äôs Accounting System (GRACC)</a>.</strong></p>

<p><em>The OSG Team operates the <a href="/services/open_science_pool.html">Open Science Pool (OSPool)</a></em> for use by research projects 
associated with a US-based academic, government, or non-profit organization, 
and with funding from the National Science Foundation through the NSF PATh 
project (NSF #2030508). Applicable researchers can obtain access to OSPool 
resources via an associated access point operated by their institution or 
collaboration, or via the <a href="https://connect.osg-htc.org/">OSG Connect service</a>. Institutions can contribute 
capacity to the OSPool (and other pools) by becoming an <a href="https://opensciencegrid.org/docs/site-planning/">OSG Site</a>.</p>

<p>Other pools within the OSG are operated by/for the research communities they 
serve, often with their own (private) access points, documentation, policies, 
etc., separate from those pertaining to using and contributing to the OSPool. 
Some pool communities or participating organizations provide application-specific 
interfaces or datasets, such that end-users may not even be aware of integration 
with OSG and its services/technologies. Some pools share capacity with one another, 
and organizations can contribute resources to more than one pool. If you‚Äôre interested
in supporting the Open Science Pool, specific projects, or any pool/research 
community, contact us at <a href="mailto:support@opensciencegrid.org">support@opensciencegrid.org</a>.</p>
