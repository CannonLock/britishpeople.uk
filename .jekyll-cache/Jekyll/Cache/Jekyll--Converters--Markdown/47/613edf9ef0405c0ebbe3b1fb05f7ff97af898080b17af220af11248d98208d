      <p>The OSG User School 2022 will occur on July 25–29, where you will learn to use high-throughput computing (HTC) systems to run large-scale computing applications at your campus or using the national-scale OSG.</p>

      <p>At the School, you will learn how HTC systems work, how to run and manage many jobs, and where to find more information and help through lectures, discussions, and hands-on activities with  OSG staff.</p>

      <p>The School is ideal for graduate students in any research area where large-scale computing is an essential part of their research process, plus we welcome applications from advanced undergraduates (especially those who are involved in graduate-level research or coursework), post-doctoral students, faculty, and staff (especially those who perform research or support/facilitate researchers).</p>

      <p>The deadline for applications has <strong>passed</strong>.</p>
