I"J<h2 id="the-myosg-and-oim-services-have-been-decommissioned">The MyOSG and OIM services have been decommissioned</h2>

<p>As a part of the larger <a href="https://opensciencegrid.org/technology/policy/service-migrations-spring-2018/">spring 2018 service migration</a>,
the OIM and MyOSG services that used to be at <em>oim.grid.iu.edu</em> and <em>myosg.grid.iu.edu</em> have
been decommissioned.  We apologize for any inconvenience.</p>

<p>The MyOSG XML queries have been migrated to <a href="https://my.opensciencegrid.org">my.opensciencegrid.org</a>; other than a hostname
change, the URL paths and query parameters are identical.  If you see any unexpected changes
in the XML structure, please contact us at <a href="mailto:help@opensciencegrid.org">help@opensciencegrid.org</a>
and we will be happy to assist you.</p>

<p>The reference topology (sites, resource, and services) and contact information kept in OIM are now
kept in internal repositories; if you need to make changes for your site, please contact
<a href="mailto:support@opensciencegrid.org">support@opensciencegrid.org</a>.</p>
