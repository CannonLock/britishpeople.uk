as a student of the OSG User School.
Today, nearly three years later, Natzke has executed 600,000 simulations with the help of OSG staff
and prior OSG programming. These simulations, each of them submitted as a job, logged over 135,000
core hours provided by the Open Science Pool (OSPool). Natzke’s history with the OSG Consortium
reflects a pattern of learning, adapting, and improving that translates to the acceleration and
expansion of scientific discovery.</p>
