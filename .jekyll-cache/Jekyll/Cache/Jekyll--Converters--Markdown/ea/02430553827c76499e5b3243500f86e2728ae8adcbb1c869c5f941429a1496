I"À<p>The TRAPPIST-1 system contains a total of seven planets, all around the size of Earth.
Three of them â€” TRAPPIST-1e, f and g â€” dwell in their starâ€™s so-called â€œhabitable zone.â€
The habitable zone, or Goldilocks zone, is a band around every star (shown here in green)
where astronomers have calculated that temperatures are just right â€” not too hot, not too
cold â€” for liquid water to pool on the surface of an Earth-like world.</p>
