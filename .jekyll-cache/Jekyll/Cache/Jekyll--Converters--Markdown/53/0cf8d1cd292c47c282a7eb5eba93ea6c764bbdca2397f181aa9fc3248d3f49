I"Ÿ<p>LIGOâ€™s detectors search for gravitational waves from deep space. With 
two detectors, researchers can use differences in the waveâ€™s arrival times 
to constrain the source location in the sky. LIGOâ€™s first data run of
its advanced gravitational wave detectors began in September 2015 and
ran through January 12, 2016. The first gravitational waves were
detected on September 14, 2015 by both detectors.</p>
