I"·<p><em>OSG is a consortium dedicated to the advancement of open science via the 
practice of distributed High Throughput Computing, and the advancement of 
its state of the art.</em></p>

<p><strong>The OSG Consortium</strong> builds and operates a set of <strong>pools of shared computing and 
data capacity for distributed high-throughput computing (dHTC)</strong>. Each pool is 
organized and operated to serve a particular research community (e.g. a campus, 
multi-institutional collaboration, etc.), using technologies and 
services provided by the core OSG Team. One of these pools, known as the 
<strong><a href="/services/open_science_pool.html">Open Science Pool</a></strong> is operated for all of US-associated 
open science. The Consortium, thus, represents the totality of all researchers, 
resources, individuals and institutions that benefit from or contribute to any 
of the OSG Fabric of Services (further below).</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://opensciencegrid.org/council/">The OSG Council</a></strong> governs the consortium ensuring that the OSG benefits 
the scientific mission of its stakeholders: the research communities, organizations 
that provide resources and services for them, including funding resources.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://opensciencegrid.org/management/">The Executive Team</a></strong> manages the core <strong><a href="/about/team/">OSG Team</a></strong>, with 
team members from various institutions organized into Areas that provide core OSG 
technologies and services required to operate pools in support of research communities. 
As of January 2022, the OSG Team is funded primarily via the <a href="https://path-cc.io/">PATh</a> (NSF #2030508), 
<a href="https://iris-hep.org/">IRIS-HEP</a> (NSF #1836650) projects, and in kind contributions from multiple entities, 
including DOE national laboratories.</p>

<h2 id="distributed-high-throughput-computing">Distributed High Throughput Computing</h2>

<p><strong>High-throughput computing (HTC)</strong> is the execution of computational work in the form 
of numerous, self-contained tasks to optimize their overall completion across 
available computing resources. Specialized by the OSG, <strong>distributed high-throughput 
computing (dHTC)</strong> involves the operation of HTC-optimized infrastructure across
many independent, collaborating administrative domains.</p>

<h2 id="the-osg-fabric-of-services">The OSG Fabric of Services</h2>

<p>The OSG provides various open-source software, other technologies, and services 
for researchers and research organizations to support their dHTC compute requirements. 
Our software and technologies allow research organizations to build dHTC systems 
at-scale from shared computing and data resources, and to make these resources 
available to researchers within virtual clusters (what the OSG calls ‚Äú<strong>pools</strong>‚Äù).</p>

<p>Some pools or participating organizations provide application-specific interfaces
or datasets, such that end-users may not even be aware of integration with 
OSG and its services/technologies. Many OSG technologies and services are 
based upon or directly leverage the <strong><a href="https://htcondor.org/">HTCondor Software Suite (HTCSS)</a></strong>, in addition
to other open-source tools that enable shared computing and data capabilities. 
These can be deployed by a research organization to create their own dHTC pool 
across participating compute and data components, making their federated capacity 
available to the researchers they serve.</p>

<p>The OSG‚Äôs <strong><a href="https://gracc.opensciencegrid.org/d/000000074/gracc-home?orgId=1&amp;search=open&amp;folder=current">Global Research Accounting (GRACC)</a></strong> system provides metrics of capacity 
contributions and usage across reporting OSG pools, including specific metrics 
for participating institutions and research projects, some of which represent 
hundreds or thousands of individual users.</p>

<p><strong><a href="/services/open_science_pool.html">The Open Science Pool (OSPool)</a></strong> provides dHTC capacity for research projects 
associated with a US-based academic, government, or non-profit organization,
and with funding from the National Science Foundation through the PATh project
(NSF #2030508). Applicable researchers can obtain access to OSPool resources 
via an access point operated by their institution or collaboration, or via the
<strong><a href="https://connect.osg-htc.org/">OSG Connect service</a></strong>.</p>
